Dear [firstname],

thank you for our chat [whenever]. [It was a pleasure/ I enjoyed it (optional)]

For the next step in the process, we would like you to complete a practical skills assessment test. Any candidate for our design engineering positions has to solve this test in a timely manner. The test will be assessed by the development team.

This task is meant to verify your understanding of different concepts (Design, HTML, CSS, JS) and show the pragmatic approach you have in delivering prototypes and mocks. 

The completion is estimated to 16 hours of work. We expect to have a working submission within a week from when you start.

The deliverable is:

Access to a codepen or GitHub repository containing your solution for us to review.
Generate the page dynamically from the dataset.
Implement the page similar to the video, including tooltips, tab switching and toggling 'show more/less' but excluding the graph.


The task is to implement a web prototype using HTML and CSS with some basic interactivity added through JS. Use the technologies and approach, or similar alternatives, as mentioned here:

A CSS extension language like SCSS.
- Content-independent CSS (over Semantic CSS)
- Angular 1, React, or another frontend framework of choice
- Optional: Deliver the solution as a composition of reusable sub-components


We expect that:

All tasks are solved in the solution
- The application has a solid commit history
- Documentation is applied to code/repository describing intent and purpose, as well as complicated/non-obvious choices in the implementation
- Bonus points for implementing suitable animations of choice

Feel free to ask any questions regarding the test.
